# AI::from("Scratch")
--
I remember failing at creating an ai from scratch for my school project, and i wanted to practice using rust, so 2 birds with one stone :)
some features i've thought about are options for precision, making the activation function a closure that you can import on init.


## Todo
- Backpropagation
- import training data into memory. (using Mnist handwritten digits data set)
- vizualisation (might just stream data with a webserver to a local website and do that part in javascript)
    - visualise digits while training
    - live drawing fed to model.
- Evaluation
